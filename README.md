- **Seamless Integration with Visual Studio Code**: 'RECS Armory' seamlessly integrates with Visual Studio Code, providing a powerful and intuitive development experience. With the GitHub Actions extension, you can manage your build workflows directly from within the editor, streamlining your development process.

- **Automated Builds and Continuous Integration**: 'RECS Armory' harnesses the power of GitHub Actions to automate builds and enable continuous integration. Whenever you push changes to your repository or create a pull request, the defined workflow automatically triggers, building your application and ensuring its integrity.

- **Reproducible Builds**: With 'RECS Armory', you can achieve reproducible builds across different environments. The project structure and Dockerfile ensure that your application is built consistently, eliminating "works on my machine" issues and promoting collaboration among team members.

## üìã Prerequisites

To fully leverage the capabilities of ''RECS Armory'', ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- **Docker**: Docker is a fundamental requirement for 'RECS Armory'. It enables the creation of containerized environments and facilitates the build and deployment processes. Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download and install Docker from the official website: [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)

- **Visual Studio Code**: While not strictly required, Visual Studio Code is highly recommended for an enhanced development experience. It provides a rich set of features and extensions that complement 'RECS Armory'. Visual Studio Code can be downloaded from: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- **GitHub Account**: To utilize the automated build and continuous integration features of 'RECS Armory', you need a GitHub account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for free at: [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)

- **Docker Hub Account**: To store and distribute your built Docker images, you'll need a Docker Hub account. Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service that allows you to push and pull Docker images. You can create a free account at: [https://hub.docker.com/signup](https://hub.docker.com/signup)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rsuar29/recs-armory.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd recs-armory

3. Build the Docker image:
    docker build -t recs-armory-image .

üöÄ Usage
To run the application, use the following command:

ü§ñ GitHub Actions
This project utilizes GitHub Actions for automated builds and continuous integration. The workflow is defined in .github/workflows/docker-build.yml.

The workflow automatically triggers on push or pull request events to the main branch. It performs the following steps:

    1. Checks out the repository code.
    2. Sets up Docker Buildx with the specified cloud builder.
    3. Logs in to Docker Hub using the provided secrets.
    4. Builds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.

To set up the GitHub Actions workflow:

    1. Create a new repository secret named DOCKER_USERNAME with your Docker Hub username.
    2. Create another repository secret named DOCKER_PASSWORD with your Docker Hub password or access token.

üåê Deployment
Provide instructions on how to deploy your application to a production environment.
